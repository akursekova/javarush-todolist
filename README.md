## Structure of the project
This is a Maven project with standard Maven project structure:

`src/main/java` contains java classes  
`src/main/resources` resources used by application  
`src/test` â€” package to store tests
`pom.xml` is in the root of the project and contains all necessary dependencies for the correct work of the project.

This application has 3 main domains: 
- Task
- Tag
- User, which are located in the `model` package.

In the root folder of the project `dev.javarush.todolist` there are packages:

`command`: transfers main classes mentioned above to the entities which will be used on service and servlet levels  
`components`: contains class _PasswordHashing_ intended for hashing user passwords
`consts`: contains class _WebConstants_ which stores constants used in the application  
`dto`: transfers main classes mentioned above to the entities which will be used on service and servlet levels  
`enums`: contains all the enums used in the application  
`exceptions`: stores all the exceptions  
`listener`: contains AppContextListener class, where all necessary entities are initialized before application starts  
`mapper`: class which helps to transfer main classes mentioned above to the entities which will be used on service and servlet levels  
`middleware`: contains classes which intended for validation of the data which comes from the User Interface  
`provider`: contains class _Provider_ which contains database properties  
`repositories`: stores classes intended to manage entities in the database: save, update, delete.  
`services`: stores classes which implements business logic, intended to manage entities between servlet and repository level  
`servlets`: stores servlet classes

There is a `web.xml` inside `WEB-INF`: it stores the information about configuration of the app.  
In current project it stores information about ExceptionHandlerServlet, which is responsible for error handling.

In the `webapp` package which is the root of the project there are following packages:  
`tag`: contains .jsp files which represent tag creation/modification form, table with all tags  
`task`: contains .jsp files which represent task creation/modification form, table with all task, task information form  
`user`: contains .jsp files which represent sign up and sign in pages  
In the root of the `webapp` package there is an index.jsp, which represent the start page of the application
